# report-issue-post

A Python server and Javascript frontend that posts issues to a GitHub repo as a single user.

**No longer in use**, this app still works but I'm no longer maintaining it. Have a look at its replacement [newtheatre/ntbotPostIssue](https://github.com/newtheatre/ntbotPostIssue). This does the same job but runs on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) so a server isn't needed and as long as you don't get > 1,000,000 issues a month it's free to run.
